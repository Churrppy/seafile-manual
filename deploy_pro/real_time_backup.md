# Seafile Real-Time Backup Server

Backup is the procedure that copies data from a primary server (which is running production service) to a backup server.

Backup is an important procedure to keep data safe. The basic backup procedure described in [this documentation](../maintain/backup_recovery.md) has a few drawbacks:

- The backup is done in fixed "backup windows" (once per day or a few times per day). The latest data written between two backup windows will be lost if the primary server storage is damaged.
- The backup procedure backup database and data directory separately. In the backup server, some entries in the database may become inconsistent with the data directory. This causes some libraries become "corrupted" after restore.

The real-time backup server uses a syncing algorithm similar to the Seafile desktop client to retrieve data from the primary server. It works as follows:

- Whenever a library is updated, the primary server notifies the backup server to retrieve the changed data. With a delta syncing algorithm, this procedure runs quickly and updates the backup server in nearly real-time.
- The backup server also checks all libraries on the primary server at a fixed period. Any new or updated libraries will be synced to the backup server. This will pick up any legged updates due to glitches in the above real-time sync procedure.
- The backup server always keep the database and data directory consistent. So no libraries on the backup server will be in corrupted state (unless they're already corrupted on the primary server).
- The full history of all libraries will be backed up. This is not like the desktop client, which only syncs the latest state of a library.

There are two sets of data that need to be backup:

- The seafile-data directory and the core library metadata tables in the seafile database. This data is the core data structures of the libraries in Seafile. They're synced to the backup server with Seafile's syncing algorithm. In this procedure, the metadata tables are kept consistent with the seafile-data directory.
- All other tables in the database (including seafile, ccnet and seahub databases) are backup with mysqldump. The mysqldump can't real_time backup the database, you can set a crontab for mysqldump at regular intervals. If you want to real_time backup the database, you can deploy the master-slave synchronization for mysql. But the seafile backup node can't as the mysql salve node.

## Configure Real-Time Backup Server

We assume you already have a primary server running, and now you want to setup a backup server.

The steps to setup the backup server are:

1. Install Seafile on the backup server
2. Configure Seafile syncing between the primary server and the backup server
3. Backup the tables in the database by `mysqldump` at regular intervals

### Install Seafile on the Backup Server

You should install Seafile Pro Edition on the backup server according to [this documentation](../deploy_pro/download_and_setup_seafile_professional_server.md). Since the real-time backup feature is only available for 5.1.0 or later, you also have to upgrade your primary server to 5.1.0 version or later.

When installing Seafile on the backup server, you have to notice:

- The database names (ccnet, seafile and seahub database) should be the same as the names on the primary server.
- You don't need to enable other Pro features, such as Office file preview, search indexing, file auditing etc.
- You can't start the seahub progress on backup server. It means that usually the Seafile backup server can't provide service.

In the following discussion, we'll use "primary server" and "master server", "backup server" and "slave server" interchangeably.

### Configure Real-time Backup in Seafile

On the primary server, add following options to seafile.conf:

```
[backup]
backup_url = http://backup-server
sync_token = c7a78c0210c2470e14a20a8244562ab8ad509734
```

On the backup server, add following options to seafile.conf:

```
[backup]
primary_url = http://primary-server
sync_token = c7a78c0210c2470e14a20a8244562ab8ad509734
sync_poll_interval = 3
```

- `backup_url`: the backup server's address in url format. You can use http or https.
- `primary_url`: the primary server's address in url format.
- `sync_token`: a secret that shared between the primary and backup server. It's 40 character SHA1 generated by the system admin. You can use `uuidgen | openssl sha1` command to generate a random token.
- `sync_poll_interval`: The backup server polls all libraries of the primary server periodically. You can set the poll interval in the unit of hours. The default interval is 1 hour, which mean the backup server will poll the primary every hour. You should choose larger intervals if you have large number of libraries.

If you use https to sync between primary and backup servers, and you're using Debian or Ubuntu servers, you need to make some changes to your system CA store. Because the server package is built on CentOS 6, if you're using Debian/Ubuntu, you have to copy the system CA bundle to CentOS's CA bundle path. Otherwise Seafile can't find the CA bundle so that the SSL connection will fail.

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs
sudo cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
sudo ln -s /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem
```

After saving the configuration, restart seafile service on the primary and backup servers. The backup server will automatically start backup on restart.

**Note**: Don't start the seahub progress on the Seafile backup server.

### Backup the Databases

Backup data from the databases on the primary server's MySQL with mysqldump:

```
mysqldump -u <user> -p<password> --databases \
--ignore-table=<seafile_db>.Repo \
--ignore-table=<seafile_db>.Branch \
--ignore-table=<seafile_db>.RepoHead \
<seafile_db> <ccnet_db> <seahub_db> > dbdump.sql
```

You should replace `<user>`, `<password>` with your MySQL admin user and password. You should replace `<seafile_db>`, `<seahub_db>` and `<ccnet_db>` with your database names.

**You should set the crontab for run the mysqldump at regular intervals.**
**Or you want to real_time backup the database, you can deploy the master-slave synchronization for mysql. But the slave node can't as the Seafile backup server's MySQL.**

### Checking Backup Status

`seaf-backup-cmd.sh` provides `status` command to view the backup status. The output is like:

```
# ./seaf-backup-cmd.sh status
Total number of libraries: xxx
Number of synchronized libraries: xxx
Number of libraries waiting for sync: xxx
Number of libraries syncing: xxx
Number of libraries failed to sync: xxx

List of syncing libraries:
xxx
xxx

List of libraries failed to sync:
xxx
xxx
```

There are a few reasons that may fail the backup of a library:

- Some data in the primary server is corrupted. The data may be in the latest state or in history. Since the backup procedure syncs the full history, corruption in history will fail the backup.
- The primary server has run seaf-fsck, which may restore a library back to an older state.

## Restore from the Backup Server

There are tow steps to restore from the backup server:

- Import the data into the Seafile backup server's MySQL.
- Enable other Pro features on the Seafile backup server, and start seahub progress `./seahub.sh start`.

#### Step1: Import Existing Data into backup server

Importing existing data into the backup server's MySQL:

```
mysql -u <user> -p<pass> < dbdump.sql
```

Replace `<user>` and `<pass>` with your MySQL admin user name and password.

#### Step2: Start the backup server's seahub

Copy the seafile's configuration from the primary server to the backup server, then start the seahub progress on the backup server.

```
./seahub.sh start
```

## Setup Backup Server for Seafile Cluster

If your primary service runs as a Seafile cluster, you have two points to notice when setting up a backup server:

1. You should only use one MySQL instance as the replication master, if you're using MariaDB cluster.
2. You have to change seafile.conf and set the `backup_url` and `sync_token` options on each Seafile node. The configuration on all primary Seafile node should be the same. They all point to the same backup server.

Currently you cannot deploy the backup service **as** a cluster. That is, you can only use a single node as backup server. This support may be added in the future.

## Managing the Real-time Backup Server

Once set up, the backup server is a fully working Seafile instance. The admin can manage the backup server in two ways:

1. Access the server via Seahub web interface, just like a normal Seafile instance.
2. Use the `seaf-backup-cmd.sh` script in the server package to manage the backup function.

The `seaf-backup-cmd.sh` script provides the following commands:

### Manually Trigger Syncing a Library

You can use the `sync` command to manually schedule backup of a library:

```
# ./seaf-backup-cmd.sh sync <library id>
```

The command will block until the backup is finished.

### Handling Backup Errors

The `--force` option of `sync` command can be used to force failing backup to complete. Permanent backup failures are usually caused by data corruption of a library in the primary server. The `--force` option asks the backup to skip corrupted objects and finish the backup.

When you find a backup error, follow two steps:

1. Run seaf-fsck on the primary server, for the failing libraries. Fsck fixes any corruption for the latest state of the libraries.
2. Run `seaf-backup-cmd.sh sync --force <library id>` on the backup server.
